### English Service { .card-title }

We gather together as one united family in Christ every Sunday morning to praise
and worship God, and to hear the Word of God. The message enlightens and reminds
us of Godâ€™s Words, guiding us to live a victorious and purposeful life according
to His plan for us.

After the service, we encourage everyone to stay for a time of fellowship. This
is an opportunity to connect with one another, share stories, and build
meaningful relationships.
