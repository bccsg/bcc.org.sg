### Care Groups { .card-title }

Our care groups (also known as cell groups) are small group gatherings that
provide a space for deeper connection, spiritual growth, and community building.
We meet together twice a month to share life, study the Bible, pray, and support
one another on their faith journeys.

Currently our Care Groups take place on alternate weeks at various locations.
