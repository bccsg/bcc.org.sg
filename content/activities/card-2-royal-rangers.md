### Royal Rangers { .card-title }

Bethany follows a curriculum from Royal Rangers, a worldwide holistic Christian
mentoring programme for children aged 5-12. Your child is nurtured holistically,
in terms of their physical, mental, spiritual, and social growth.

The Royal Rangers programme provides a dynamic and interactive platform where
children can learn valuable life skills, build character, and discover the
principles of the Christian faith in a fun and supportive environment.

The mission of Royal Rangers is to reach, teach, and keep boys and girls for
Christ. Children go through a variety of activities each week to complete
different merits which equip and empower them for life.

Let your child experience the fun of Royal Rangers and get to know other
children on a Sunday morning while you join in our English Services.
