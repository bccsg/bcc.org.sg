## History

The church grew in numbers and we continued to worship in the premise for 2 over
decades. The building began to show signs of age over time. Severe cracks
started to appear on the roofing, the ceiling surrounding the pillars, along the
sides of walls and doors, and pockets of depressions were found on the floor in
the interior of the church. It was due to these alarming visible cracks and
ensuing concern for the safety of worshippers that in 2018, members and leaders
of the church unanimously decided to rebuild the church. However, due to the
pandemic, we were forced to put the project on hold.

After 3 years of waiting and seeking God, the church decided to take the step of
faith to embark on the rebuilding amidst the challenges and rising cost hit by
the pandemic. After more than 2 years of rebuilding, Bethany Christian Center
reopened its door for worship at 167 on Easter Sunday, 31 March 2024. Praise be
to God!
